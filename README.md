# What

This will deploy one or more clusters in the cloud, with optional post-install tasks defined by template.

# Supported platforms

## Container
 * Kubernetes
 * K3s
 * Docker EE
 * Openshift 3.11
 * Openshift 3.11 with CRI-O

## Cloud
 * AWS
 * GCP
 * Azure

1. Install the CLI for your choice of cloud provider and ensure it is configured:
 * AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html
 * GCP: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts
 * Azure: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest

2. Install and enable Docker.

3. Install bash-completion (optional), eg:
```
$ brew install bash-completion
```
You will need to restart your shell.

4. Run the install script:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewh1978/px-deploy/master/install.sh | bash
```
This will:
 * build the Docker image
 * create and populate `$HOME/.px-deploy`
 * provide instructions to configure `.bash_profile`/`.zshrc`

5. Deploy something:
```
px-deploy create --name=myDeployment --template=clusterpair
```
This will provision a VPC and some other objects, and deploy into it from the template.

6. Connect via SSH:
```
px-deploy connect --name myDeployment
```

7. Execute a command:
```
px-deploy connect --name myDeployment "storkctl get clusterpair"
```

8. Tear down the deployment:
```
px-deploy destroy --name myDeployment
```

# NOTES

The deployments can be listed:
```
$ px-deploy list

The templates can be listed:
```
$ px-deploy templates
NAME           DESCRIPTION
clusterpair    Deploys 2 clusters with Portworx, sets up and configures a cluster pairing, and
               deploys a set of apps and a migration template.
cockroach      Deploys a single K8s cluster with Portworx and CockroachDB running
harbor         Deploys a single K8s cluster with Portworx and Harbor (https://goharbor.io/)
metro          Deploys 2 K8s clusters in AWS with a stretched Portworx cluster. It configures
               Metro, a GUI and Petclinic, ready for a manual failover demo
postgres-demo  Cluster with Portworx
px-central     A single K8s and Portworx cluster with PX-Central Alpha & Grafana installed
px-with-gui    A single K8s cluster with Portworx, Lighthouse and VNC access to access the
               Lighthouse UI for demo purposes
px             A single Kubernetes cluster with Portworx installed
training       Deploys training clusters
```

Generate a list of IP address, suitable for training:
```
$ px-deploy status --name trainingDeployment
master-1 34.247.219.101 ec2-34-247-219-101.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
master-2 34.254.155.6 ec2-34-254-155-6.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

The `defaults.yml` file sets a number of deployment variables:
 * `aws_ebs` - a list of EBS volumes to be attached to each worker node. This is a space-separate list of type:size pairs, for example: `"gp2:30 standard:20"` will provision a gp2 volume of 30 GB and a standard volume of 20GB
 * `aws_region` - AWS region
 * `aws_type` - the AWS machine type for each node
 * `cloud` - the cloud on which to deploy (aws or gcp)
 * `clusters` - the number of clusters to deploy
 * `k8s_version` - the version of Kubernetes to deploy
 * `stop_after` - stop the intances after this many hours
 * `post_script` - script to run on each master after deployment, output will go to stdout
 * `auto_destroy` - if set to `true`, destroy deployment immediately after deploying (usually used with a `post_script` to output the results of a test or benchmark)
 * `nodes` - the number of worker nodes on each cluster
 * `platform` - can be set to either k8s, k3s, none, dockeree, ocp3 or ocp3c (OCPv3 with CRI-O)
 * `px_version` - the version of Portworx to install
 * `gcp_disks` - similar to aws_ebs, for example: `"pd-standard:20 pd-ssd:30"`
 * `gcp_region` - GCP region
 * `gcp_type` - the GCP machine type for each node
 * `gcp_zone` - GCP zone
 * `azure_disks` - similar to aws_ebs, for example: `"20 30"`
 * `azure_type` - the Azure machine type for each node

There are two ways to override these variables. The first is to specify a template with the `--template=...` parameter. For example:
```
$ cat templates/clusterpair.yml
clusters: 2
scripts: ["install-px", "clusterpair"]
```

More on `scripts` below.

The second way to override the defaults is to specify on the command line. See `px-deploy create -h` for a full list. For example, to deploy petclinic into the `foo` deployment:
```
px-deploy create --name=foo --clusters=5 --template=petclinic --nodes=6
```

This example is a mixture of both methods. The template is applied, then the command line parameters are applied, so not only is the template overriding the defaults, but also the parameters are overriding the template.

`scripts` is a list of scripts to be executed on each master node. For example:
```
$ cat ~/.px-deploy/scripts/petclinic
# Install petclinic on each cluster
kubectl apply -f /assets/petclinic.yml
```

These variables are passed to the script:
 * `$nodes`
 * `$clusters`
 * `$px_version`
 * `$k8s_version`

All files in `~/.px-deploy/assets` will be copied to `/assets` on the master nodes. They are then available to be used by the script, as above.

In addition to these, there are some more variables available:
 * `$cluster` - cluster number

There is also an optional cluster object. At the moment, all it can be used for is defining cluster-specific scripts. These will be executed after the scripts above. For example:
```
cluster:
- id: 1
  scripts: ["script-1", "script-2"]
- id: 2
  scripts: ["script-3", "script-4"]
```

`post_script` is a script that will be run on each master node after all of the scripts have completed, and the output will go to stdout. The default is to display the external IP address of master-1, but it could be used to show benchmark outputs, for example.

Last, environment variables can be define in templates or defaults.yml, and these are also available to scripts:
```
$ cat templates/metro.yml
...
env:
  px_suffix=csi%3Dtrue
  licenses: "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
```
Enviroment variables can also be defined on the command line:
```
px-deploy create -n foo -t clusterpair -e install_apps=true,foo=bar

The `install-px` script looks for an environment variable called `cloud_drive`. If it exists, it will deploy Portworx using a clouddrive rather than looking for all attached devices:
```
px-deploy create -n foo -t px -e cloud_drive=type%3Dgp2%2Csize%3D150
```

# Bugs

 * The Azure Vagrant plugin will [fail when provisioning VMs in parallel](https://github.com/Azure/vagrant-azure/issues/229), so px-deploy disables parallel provisioning. This is really slow, and if a template uses a script that will not terminate until another VM is up, then it will never finish provisioning.
 * Provisioning multiple deployments in an Azure region at the same time gives DNS errors and fails.
